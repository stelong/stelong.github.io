August 2021, Brussels. I am sitting at my kitchen table having lunch before getting back to PhD thesis write-up in one of those infinitely long summer days. It’s warm, windows wide open, a fly interrupts my peaceful moment to roam above my head. Why does it loop like that indefinitely instead of figuring out that flying straight would lead directly to the sky? I don’t get it.

It had been a while since I wanted to learn a bit of image processing for motion tracking, so I took my phone out and started recording.
