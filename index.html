    <p>I am a mathematician with a strong passion for life sciences. Throughout human evolution, attempts to control
        nature have become more frequent, sophisticated, and successful. Understanding nature's intrinsic chaotic
        behavior requires formalism and imaginative structures. Imho, fully unraveling nature's complexity will never be
        accomplished. Yet, scientific progress is what took humanity to the moon and enabled the discovery of
        penicillin. Because of this, I have dedicated my life to scientific research. I aim to make my modest
        contribution to the collective effort of pushing the boundaries of science. My studies have progressed from
        theoretical mathematics to applied mathematics, to biomedical engineering, to systems biology and toxicology, to
        (currently) applied machine learning.</p>
